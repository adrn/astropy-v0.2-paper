Scope of the Paper
==================

The aim of the paper is to give a formal overview of the capabilities of 
Astropy in 0.2, and to provide a citable peer-reviewed reference for 
anyone using Astropy to cite. This will provide credit for all the work 
that the Astropy developers have put into the project.

Affiliated packages will not be detailed in this paper, since many are 
still in active development.

Journal
======

The journal to which the paper will be submitted has not been decided 
yet. Possible options include:

* A&A (code section, and open access option)
* PASP

Rules for Authorship
====================

Anyone who has contributed at least one commit to one of the following 
repositories by the final 0.2.0 release will be included on the paper:

* astropy
* astropy-logo
* astropy-website
* package-template

The author list will be:

1. Astropy Collaboration (first author)

2. The coordination committee

3. The developers

The coordination committee and the developers will be ordered by
contributions, which for this paper will broadly be related to the number of
commits (we will not use the number of commits blindly as a metric, since it
does not always fully represent the extent of contributions by an individual).

There will be papers for future major releases of Astropy, so if you are not
included in this paper, you will still eventually get credited for your work!
