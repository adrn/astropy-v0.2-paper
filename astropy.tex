\abstract{
We present the first public version of the open-source and community-developed
Python package, Astropy. This package aims to provide core astronomy-related
functionality to the community, including for example support for
domain-specific file formats such as Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)
files, Virtual Observatory (VO), and common ASCII table formats, unit and
physical quantity conversions, physical constants specific to astronomy,
celestial coordinate and time transformations, world coordinate system (WCS)
support, generalized containers for representing gridded as well as tabular
data, and a framework for cosmological transformations and conversions.
Significant functionality is under active development, such as a model fitting
framework, VO client and server tools, and aperture and point spread function
(PSF) photometry tools. Participation in development is open to anyone
interested in joining the project.

\section{Introduction}

% Authors: Tom R., Erik T., Perry G.

The Python programming language\footnote{\url{http://www.astropy.org}} has been
one of the fastest-growing programming languages in the astronomy community in
the last decade. While there have been a number of efforts to develop Python
packages for astronomy-specific functionality, these efforts have been
fragmented, and several dozens of packages have been developed across the
community with little or no coordination, leading to duplication and a lack of
homogeneity across packages. This in turn has made it difficult for users to
get set up with all the required packages needed in an Astronomer's toolkit.
Since a number of these packages depend on individual or small groups of
developers, packages are sometimes no longer maintained, or simply become
unavailable, which is detrimental to long-term research and research
reproducibility.

The Astropy project was started\footnote{Following discussions on
the \texttt{astropy} mailing list at
\url{http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/astropy}} in 2011 out of a desire
to bring together developers across the field of astronomy in order to
coordinate efforts to develop a common Python library. The aim of this library
was to cover much of the astronomy-specific functionality needed by
researchers, complementing more general standard scientific packages such as
NumPy \citep{oliphant2006guide,van2011numpy} and SciPy \citep{jones2001scipy},
which are invaluable for numerical array-based calculations, and more general
scientific algorithms (e.g. interpolation, integration, clustering, etc.)
respectively. To date, over 130 people are signed up to the
\textit{development} mailing list for the Astropy project\footnote{
\url{https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups\#!forum/astropy-dev}}.

Most efforts in the Astropy project to date have gone towards developing the
core \astropy package. However, we note the scope of the Astropy project is
not simply to create a core package, but more generally to bring together
authors of existing packages to work together and agree on including a common
set of functionality in the core package (and in some cases deprecating their
packages if all functionality ends up in \astropy), since the aim is
ultimately to simplify the landscape of packages available to users. In
addition, the Astropy project includes more specialized Python packages (which
we call \textit{affiliated} packages) that are not included in the core
package for various reasons: for some the functionality is in early stages of
development and is not robust; or the license is not compatible with Astropy;
the package includes large files; or the functionality is mature, but too
specific to be included in a core package.


In this paper, we present the first public release (v0.2) of the \astropy
package. We provide an overview of the current capabilities
(\S\ref{sec:capabilities}), our development workflow (\S\ref{sec:workflow}),
and planned functionality (\S\ref{sec:future}).

% Authors: Erik T., Adrian, Demitri


\subsection{Tables and Gridded data}

% Authors: Tom A., Tom R., Wolfgang K., Erik T.

The \texttt{astropy.table} and \texttt{astropy.nddata} sub-packages contain
classes (\texttt{Table} and \texttt{NDData}) that allow users to represent
astronomical data in the form of tables or n-dimensional gridded datasets,
including meta-data (for example units).

The \texttt{Table} class provides a high-level wrapper to Numpy structured
arrays, which are essentially arrays that have fields (or columns) with
heterogeneous data types, and any number of rows. Numpy structured arrays are
however difficult to manipulate or modify, so the \texttt{Table} class makes
it easy for users to create a table from columns, add/remove columns or rows,
and mask values from the table. In addition, tables can be easily
read/written from/to common file formats using the \texttt{Table.read} and
\texttt{Table.write} methods. In addition to providing easy manipulation and
input/output of table objects, the \texttt{Table} class allows units to be
specified for each column using the \texttt{astropy.units} framework, and
also allows the \texttt{Table} object to contain arbitrary meta-data (stored
in \texttt{Table.meta}).


The \texttt{NDData} class ...
