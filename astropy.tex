\begin{abstract}
We present the first public version of the open-source and community-developed
Python package, Astropy. This package aims to provide core Astronomy-related
functionality to the community, including for example support for
domain-specific file formats such as Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)
files, Virtual Observatory (VO), and common ASCII table formats, unit and
physical quantity conversions, physical constants specific to Astronomy,
celestial coordinate and time transformations, world coordinate system (WCS)
support, generalized containers for representing gridded as well as tabular
data, and a framework for cosmological transformations and conversions.
Significant functionality is under active development, such as a model fitting
framework, VO client and server tools, and aperture and point spread function
(PSF) photometry tools. Participation in development is open to anyone
interested in joining the project.

\subsection{Tables and Gridded data}

% Authors: Tom A., Tom R., Wolfgang K., Erik T.

The \texttt{astropy.table} and \texttt{astropy.nddata} sub-packages contain
classes (\texttt{Table} and \texttt{NDData}) that allow users to represent
astronomical data in the form of tables or n-dimensional gridded datasets,
including meta-data (for example units).

The \texttt{Table} class provides a high-level wrapper to Numpy structured
arrays, which are essentially arrays that have fields (or columns) with
heterogeneous data types, and any number of rows. Numpy structured arrays are
however difficult to manipulate or modify, so the \texttt{Table} class makes
it easy for users to create a table from columns, add/remove columns or rows,
and mask values from the table. In addition, tables can be easily read/written
from/to common file formats using the \texttt{Table.read} and
\texttt{Table.write} methods. In addition to providing easy manipulation and
input/output of table objects, the \texttt{Table} class allows units to be
specified for each column using the \texttt{astropy.units} framework, and also
allows the \texttt{Table} object to contain arbitrary meta-data (stored in
\texttt{Table.meta}).

The \texttt{NDData} class ...
