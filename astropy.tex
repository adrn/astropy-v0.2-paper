\begin{abstract}
We present the first public version of the open-source and community-developed Python package, Astropy. This package aims to provide core Astronomy-related functionality to the community, including for example support for domain-specific file formats such as Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) files, Virtual Observatory (VO), and common ASCII table formats, unit and physical quantity conversions, physical constants specific to Astronomy, celestial coordinate and time transformations, world coordinate system (WCS) support, generalized containers for representing gridded as well as tabular data, and a framework for cosmological transformations and conversions. Significant functionality is under active development, such as a model fitting framework, VO client and server tools, and aperture and point spread function (PSF) photometry tools. Participation in development is open to anyone interested in joining the project.
